# spcalc
sp calculator, basic (Delphi)

Note:
As it wasn't definitely stated in task description about the used battery type and capacity, these supposals were done:
Software calculates amount of LiFo 50Ah batteries needed to store electricity generated by Solar Panels enough to meet needs of user (according to his/her input).

These constants could be changed in ```SpCalculatorUnit.pas```:

- ```BATT_DEF_CAPACITY = 50;```  (initial capacity of battery in Ah, integer)
- ```BATT_EFF_RATIO = 0.9;```    (initial effectivity ratio for LiFo batteries, float, lies in range 0.0..1.0)
